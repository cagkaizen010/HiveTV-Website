However he grew an inferiority complex as he felt that his intelligence is lacking and that he could have done better in life. Ambitiousness got a hold of him as he tried to rush finishing his tech courses and burned him out. Self studying how to utilize magical technology in the process. This led him to a dark path where he felt directionless in life and all he had was magical technology to keep him company. This brought him to Siga’s Mafia, when he ran into them and was brought into their base when he felt concerned for him as he walked towards a harbor. Kaizen now resides in Siga’s base as the technological manager of the weapons and logistics of the mafia."

As a last resort, he extracted her soul and kept it in a container and built a body to withstand said soul. The body he created resembled his daughter, except with mechanical components and couldn’t finish one of the arms. The Gods, who inhabit Clockwork city, noticed this life manipulation, treated it as a crime and stopped their blessing towards Veru’s father. The government of Clockwork City, corrupted by the Gabbro Mafia, put him on trial to take control of Veru to destroy Gabbro’s political opponents and replicate her to build an automaton army. However one day, a rumored new Surface God arrived in Clockwork City and accepted Veru and her father after realizing that the man meant well and just wanted to save his daughter."
