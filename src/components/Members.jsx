As a last resort, he extracted her soul and kept it in a container and built a body to withstand said soul. The body he created resembled his daughter, except with mechanical components and couldn’t finish one of the arms. The Gods, who inhabit Clockwork city, noticed this life manipulation, treated it as a crime and stopped their blessing towards Veru’s father. The government of Clockwork City, corrupted by the Gabbro Mafia, put him on trial to take control of Veru to destroy Gabbro’s political opponents and replicate her to build an automaton army. However one day, a rumored new Surface God arrived in Clockwork City and accepted Veru and her father after realizing that the man meant well and just wanted to save his daughter."
